SENSOR ARRANGEMENT
1. Touch sensor at front
2. Distance sensor at front
3. Color sensor at front

AUTONOMOUS PLAN
1. Drive forward until touch
2. Do the appropriate back up and turn left
3. Drive forward until reading or distance is < 2" to ensure reading exists
4. Reverse the same distance and perform opposite turn
5. Use distance sensor to gauge movement.
6. Move backwards through appropriate threshold.
